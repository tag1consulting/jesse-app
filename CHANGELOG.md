# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The **bridge** (Rust, `bridge/Cargo.toml`) and the **iOS app** (`Jesse/`) are
**versioned independently** — each entry names the component and its version.
The bridge follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html);
the app uses `MARKETING_VERSION (CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` (e.g. `1.0 (2)`),
where the build number increments every release. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Every commit that changes a component **must** bump that component's version and
add an entry here — enforced by `scripts/version-guard.sh` (the pre-push hook and
CI both run it). See the "Versioning" section of `bridge/README.md`.

## [Unreleased]

## [Bridge 0.1.1] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- `/health` now returns the bridge `version` (the crate version) unconditionally,
  before the auth-gated operator fields — a version string isn't sensitive.
- The startup banner shows the running version: `Jesse Bridge v0.1.1 → http://…`.

### Changed
- Version increments are now mandatory and enforced. `scripts/version-guard.sh`
  fails a commit that changes `bridge/` without bumping `bridge/Cargo.toml`'s
  version (and adding a CHANGELOG entry); a tracked pre-push hook
  (`scripts/hooks/pre-push`, installed via `scripts/install-hooks.sh`) blocks such
  a push locally, and CI re-checks.

## [App 1.0 (2)] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- Settings shows a **Version** section: the app's own version and build (read from
  the bundle, never hardcoded) and the last-seen **bridge** version from
  `GET /health` (or "unknown" until first fetched).
- `JesseClient.health()` (behind `JesseClientProtocol`) parses the bridge version;
  `BridgeVersionStore` persists the last-seen value for display.

## [Bridge 0.1.0] — baseline

Initial baseline of the Rust bridge: headless `claude -p` runner behind bearer
auth over a Tailscale-only bind, with the job store (turn-survives-disconnect),
SSE live streaming, cancel, prompt overrides, `/jesse/title`, and optional APNs
push.

## [App 1.0 (1)] — baseline

Initial baseline of the SwiftUI app: conversation threads, Ask/Tell modes,
Markdown rendering, spoken replies, Siri shortcuts, QR pairing, attachments,
thread history/search/folders, and AI conversation titles.
